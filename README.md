# Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM
To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

* Autoencoder is an unsupervised artificial neural network that is trained to copy its input to output.
* An autoencoder will first encode the image into a lower-dimensional representation, then decodes the representation back to the image.
* The goal of an autoencoder is to get an output that is identical to the input. Autoencoders uses MaxPooling, convolutional and upsampling layers to denoise the image.
* We are using MNIST Dataset for this experiment.
* The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits.
* The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
* The dataset has a collection of 60,000 handwrittend digits of size 28 X 28.
* Here we build a convolutional neural network model that is able to classify to it's appropriate numerical value.
